                    <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started">React Native</a><br />
                    This website offers documentation on React Native for begining and advanced developers.
                    This is useful information for anyone looking to build a mobile app, because React Native is the best tool for developing an app for both iOS and Andriod.
                    I will personally be using this as a resource to help create my first native app.<br />

                    This is a link to a document containing UNIX/LINUX commands. This is a useful resource to anyone working in the command line because not only are all the commands in one place, but they're categorized.
                    I will be using this resource to help me memorize all the commands listed.<br />

                    Stackoverflow is a great resource for anyone who codes. It's a popular place where developers can
                    gain and share knowledge. I will be using this resource to search for answers when I come across a question.<br />
